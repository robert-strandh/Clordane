\chapter{Breakpoints}

\section{Creating or destroying a breakpoint}

When the mouse is in a source window, \pollpoint{} are shown as blue
cursors.  A \breakpoint{} set are shown as red cursors.

Clicking with the left mouse button on a blue cursor will create a
\breakpoint{} at that \pollpoint{}, and the cursor will change color
to red.

Clicking with the left mouse button on a red cursor will pop up a menu
with several choices concerning that \breakpoint{}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Destroy the breakpoint.
\item Add a form.  This choice will open an code input window
  allowing the user to type a form.  Each time the program control
  reaches a \breakpoint{}, the form is evaluated.
\item Remove the form.
\item Etc.
\end{itemize}
