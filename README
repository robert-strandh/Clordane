Clordane is a project for which no code exists yet.

The purpose of the project is to specify, and ultimately create, a
debugger for Common Lisp.

We believe that the current situation when it comes to development and
debugging tools for free Common Lisp systems can be improved.
Clordane is meant to be part of such improvements.

Implementing Clordane will require substantial implementation-specific
work.  For that, we also need to specify protocols that allow Clordane
to communicate with the implementations.  However, initially, we
concentrate our efforts on the user interface and what can be done
with it.

While the main purpose of Clordane is to serve as a debugger for the
application programmer, we also include ideas for how it can serve as
a debugging tool for the system programmer, i.e., the programmer
working on implementing or maintaining a Common Lisp system.
