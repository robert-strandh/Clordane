The purpose of the project create a debugger for Common Lisp.  The
current code contains a small subset of the functionality we would
like to see, and a mock-up demo to show the interaction between
Clordane and an application being debugged.

We believe that the current situation when it comes to development and
debugging tools for free Common Lisp systems can be improved.
Clordane is meant to be part of such improvements.

While the main purpose of Clordane is to serve as a debugger for the
application programmer, we also include ideas for how it can serve as
a debugging tool for the system programmer, i.e., the programmer
working on implementing or maintaining a Common Lisp system.
